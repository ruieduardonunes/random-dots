## Getting started

In the [Play](http://ruieduardo.com/random-dots) interface, use the blue square to generate new words. You can also click on Play with Images to get random images instead.

Everytime a new image appears, try to think about how that word, or image can help you describe the problem or idea you have at hand.

In collaboration with Fiona Fox.
